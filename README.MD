#  Tutorial: Decision Tables in Excel

This is a modified sample of the work done by [www.baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com), credit goes to them.

Decision tables are a "precise yet compact" (ref. Wikipedia) way of representing conditional logic, and are well suited 
to business level rules.

Drools supports managing rules in a spreadsheet format. Supported formats are Excel (XLS), and CSV, which means that a 
variety of spreadsheet programs can be used for defining the business rules.
